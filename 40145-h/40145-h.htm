January is Aquarius, which being translated
means "water-wagon."  The only folks
who never heard of Aquarius live in the
corn-belt of Kentucky.</p>

15th to the 20th it will do it.</p>

will reign during the last week in January,

<h2>HOW TO SKATE</h2>

<table cellpadding="1">
<tr><td style="width:80%">
<p>February is perhaps as good a month as any other to learn to
skate.</p>

<p>The simplest, and most approved method, is as follows:</p>

<p>One high-ball, another high-ball, 1 more
high-ball, simply a high-ball, just one more
high-ball, ditto, the same, and lastly, a highball.
(Note&mdash;After the glass is full say,
"Not another drop.")</p>

<p>You will be surprised at the ease with
which you can skate.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>"Spreading the Eagle" is a very pretty
and artistic skating figure. It is done by
trying to get from one side of the street to
the other all in the same night.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>"Looping the lamp-post" is also quite an
achievement in skating. It doesn't make
any difference which of the two lamp-posts
you loop&mdash;take your choice. It is difficult
to give directions how to do this. The feat
has to be seen to be learned. There is a
simpler way of doing it, however, and that
is&mdash;stand perfectly still while the lamp-post
passes around you.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>Two persons skating together for mutual
assistance are known as "a pair of skates."</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>An expert skater can skate just as well in
July as in February.</p>

<h2>HOW TO COMPOSE A SHORT STORY</h2>

<table cellpadding="1">
<tr><td style="width:80%">
<p>"Ambitious" asks the compiler of
this Almanack to tell her the easiest
way to compose a short story.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>This depends somewhat on the short
story, but a few general observations may be
of interest. Some short stories are more
excited than others.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>Lead the short story to a quiet place and
soothe it by praise delivered in a gentle,
monotonous, but authoritative tone of voice.
Be careful not to criticize, as that will make
it more and more nervous. When the short
story shows signs of yielding to this influence,
smooth it gently with one hand and pat it
on the back with the other. When quite
composed, withdraw quietly, still speaking
in a low tone.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>A short story by Mary Wilkins can be
composed more quickly than a short story
by Kipling. In the latter case it may be
necessary to gently persuade the short story
to take an opiate.</p>

<h2>SPRING, GENTLE SPRING</h2>

<table cellpadding="1">
<tr><td style="width:80%">
<p>One life-size morning nearly six thousand
years ago Jubal sat outside of dear old
Eden, whanged his harp and warbled the
following:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Gentle Spring has come at last,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">So keep your furnace fires full blast!"</span>
</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>It was thus that Spring was invented, also
the first Spring poet. But why Spring
should appeal to humanity as a season of
romance, no one who gives this problem
serious thought can imagine.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>It was in the Spring that poor old Adam
first had to work, and from that time on we
have had that tired feeling in the Spring.
(See footnote.)</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>It was also in the Spring that Eve
wearied of her fig-leaf toque. She stuck a
couple lyre bird tails in one side, three lotos
buds in the other, and that settled it. Ever
since man has had to hustle in the Spring to
get his wife a new hat. (See footnote.)</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>It was in the Spring that Cain moved.
That became a habit with humanity and
knocked more romance out of Spring.</p>

<h2>HINTS TO AMATEUR GARDENERS</h2>

<table cellpadding="1">
<tr><td style="width:80%">
<p>In the spring look after your potatoes carefully.
Have their eyes examined by a
good oculist, and provide spectacles for
such as need them.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>Never string your beans till they are old
enough to understand it. If you begin too
early, they are apt to lose their temper.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>Don't attempt to graft your pie-plants.
Many have tried grafting a custard to a
mince, in the hope that the brandy in the
latter would assimilate with the custard and
make a Tom and Jerry, but it never works.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>Before planting your punkins, carefully
remove the punk.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>If you have any difficulty harvesting the
fruit of your boot-tree, use a boot-jack.</p>
<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>Owing to the well-known fact that the
mongoose is the deadly foe of snakes, it is
thought that the best way to exterminate
them from your garden is to cultivate the
mon-gooseberry. Try it.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

tulip family, although the latter has a strong
affinity for it.</p></td>

bluff. When you think the bluff is strong
enough, take it to a bank. If it goes there,
you will have no further trouble. Your
credit is now ready to transplant. Should
it begin to droop, give it a check. Be
careful not to use too many, for the proper
use of the credit-plant is to enable its owner

<h2>HOW TO PLANT A BEER GARDEN</h2>

<table cellpadding="1">
<tr><td style="width:80%">
<p>Now is the time for the ruddy faced
beer gardener to lay out his beer
garden. First procure a license and a
few nice rustic chairs and tables. Next
extract the seeds from a couple of seedy old
suits and get your wife to sew them. Your
barber will gladly supply you with cuttings,
or, if you have the chance, unscrew a dozen
or so bulbs from some healthy young electric
light plant.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>With ordinary summer weather you
should soon have a blooming fine lot of
Anheuser bushes. As soon as the "buds"
begin to pop, pack the roots with ice.
Care should be taken to keep the plants
from drying out.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>Bottle flies, while annoying, do no real
injury to the plant, and a judicious use of
fly-paper will hold them in check.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>In weeding, the beer gardener should be
careful to distinguish between true widow's
weeds and grass widow's weeds. The
latter not only add color and beauty to the
garden, but also give life to the plant.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>Beer was never worn so much or used so
extensively for interior decoration as it is today.
There is a ready market for it at five
cents a small bunch, and with intelligent
grafting the bearing of the plant can be
increased tenfold.</p>

<p><i>How to Trim Rich Relations.</i></p>

<p>This is a very dangerous and
delicate operation as the subjects
can only be approached
when they are asleep.</p>

<p>Provide yourself with a black-jack,
a bottle of chloroform and a sponge.
About three in the morning enter the
room where the Richest Relation is
sleeping. Going noiselessly to the bed,
hold the sponge saturated with chloroform
above the Richest Relation's
nose. As his sleep becomes more
profound, lower the sponge, and finally,
with a quick motion, jam it in his
mouth. Then strike his head with the
black-jack, using all your strength.
Rich Relations are suspicious and you
cannot be too careful in business matters.
This done, cut out the gold,
silver, or bills, from his pockets, and
any jewels or trinkets that you may
find.</p>

<p>Note: In most cases it will not be
necessary to kill the subject before you
can do the trimming.</p>

<h2>RECIPE FOR MAKING PUMPKIN PIE</h2>

<tr><td style="width:80%">
<p>THE KIND THAT MOTHER DIDN'T USED TO MAKE</p>

<p>(Copyrighted)</p>

<p>First get your pumpkin. Then kill it
and skin it. Cut pumpkin into small
hunks with an axe. Boil the hunks.
Boil them some more. Continue to boil
hunks until they become a mucky gob.
Unless you produce a mucky gob, the pie
will be lumpy. Add fresh picked eggs to
common cow's milk. Beat the eggs. They
may be hard to beat, but beat them. Use
a carpet beater if necessary. Now pinch
the salt and add the pinch. Add a dash of
cinnamon, add a few nutmegs (whole);
these will give the pie that rich, nutty flavor
so much desired. Add three-fourths cup of
molasses. Do not add mustard&mdash;this is
not a mustard plaster, it is a pie. Now add
this mixture to the mucky gob. Stir until
thoroughly mixed. Let stand while you
give your pie-pans a coat of crust. Then
pour mixture into pie-pans until they slop
over. Place in a hot oven. When you
can't stick a fork into the pies, they are
done. Remove pies from oven and place
on the back piazza to cool. If the dog
likes them, they're all right.</p></td>

<h2>HOW TO VIEW AN ECLIPSE</h2>

<table cellpadding="1">
<tr><td style="width:80%">
<p>To properly view an eclipse to its full, a
party of several good spirits should
get together. Whether an eclipse of
the sun or the moon, each should take a glass
and smoke it.  A great deal depends on
the quality and character of the glass. Some
glasses are much more certain to reveal an
eclipse than are others.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>If the first glass when properly smoked
does not show the eclipse, try another and
a stronger one. It is very probable that this
glass will show the sun or the moon in the
throes of an eclipse. Still another glass will
show two suns or two moons. The third
glass is likely to show several moons and
several suns, fixed stars and those that need
fixing, comets and milky ways, sky-rockets
and pin-wheels, all combining to eclipse the
finest display of Fourth of July fireworks
ever projected by the mind of man.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>And when the beholder of this mighty
spectacle wakes up during the afternoon of
the following day and sees but one simple
unadorned sun doing business in the whole
expanse of the broad, blue heavens, he has
a feeling of pity for all those who retired
early the night before and missed the social,
spiritual, and educative uplift that comes
from viewing an eclipse under just the proper
conditions.</p>

<h2>FARMING IN ALASKA</h2>

<table cellpadding="1">
<tr><td style="width:80%">
<p>It is encouraging to note that farming in
our far Northwest possessions is on the
boom. [Note to printer&mdash;be careful not
to make "bum" out of "boom."] A bulletin
issued by the Agricultural Department of
our government, just as we go to press,
shows that there are at present in Alaska
12 farms, four oxen, 13 cows, 176
chickens, 10 pigs, several cases of pneumonia
and numerous games of "freeze-out."
During the fiscal year there was harvested
in Alaska $165 worth of hay, $95 worth
of eggs and poultry, and a big crop of ice.
There are certain advantages of farming in
Alaska. In harvest time, for instance, a
man never sweats at work. He markets
his milk frozen and sells it by the hunk.
You never hear of anybody crying over
spilt milk in Alaska. It's the same way
with eggs&mdash;no cold storage needed; the
eggs are frozen before they are layed, thus
retaining their fine, fresh flavor until used.
You never hear of an egg passing from the
sublime to the ridiculous stage in Alaska.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>Farmers in Alaska plow with ice-picks
and shoot the seed into the soil with a
double-barreled shotgun. The 12 farmers
in Alaska held a farmers' institute recently
to talk over prospects for the current year.
Basing prospects on $165 worth of hay
raised last year, they figure that if conditions
are favorable they will raise $175 worth
this year.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">One of Our Awful Smart Boys</span></h3>

<p>Little George Hathadash lives in
Megawolloppey, Maine, and is now
three years old.</p>

<p>This brave ruddy-cheeked boy immediately
took the Megawolloppey agency for
the "Saturday Evening Roast," feeling sure
that his ruddy cheek would carry him
through successfully. Next Sunday, when
everybody was gathered in church, who
should come toddling down the aisle but
George Hathadash distributing his first bundle
of "Roasts," just as he had seen the train
boy sell candy on a train of cars. "Better
and brighter than any thermon," cried
George Hathadash in his childish treble.
"Here's your 'Thaturday Evening Roast,'
the brother-in-law of the 'Ladies' Wall
Paper.' Better and brighter than any
thermon."</p>

<p>Of course that attracted attention, and
almost before he knew it George had
disposed of his whole bundle and established
himself in business. He is now well on
his way to win the beautiful prize of a silver
carving knife that the "Roast" offers as an
extra inducement to its hustling young
salesmen.</p>

<p>There are other prizes and any boy with
a good ruddy cheek is likely to get one of
them.</p>

<p>But all boys are not like George Hathadash.
We think <i>he</i> is going to be a
President of the Common Council.</p>

<h2>ADVICE TO PARENTS</h2>

<table cellpadding="1">
<tr><td style="width:80%">
<p>It is now pretty generally believed that
the name given to one to bear with him
night and day, during all his years, has a
most important influence in the work of
shaping his life and fortune.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>No doubt a careful investigation of the
subject would show that most of the bare-pated
men of the nation are so because
while they were still helpless little children
they were named Archibald, Theobald,
Baldwin, and the like, whereas, had they
been named Harry, or Harold, or Aaron,
they would still be blest with well-thatched
polls.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>It is the bounden duty of parents to determine
the business or profession in which
they intend their children shall engage. If
they wish their son to become a fancy poultry-breeder
they should name him Egbert or
Henry; if they wish him to become a surgeon
they should call him Lancelot; if an
arithmetician, Adam; if a clown, Guy or
Joshua; if a street car driver, Oscar; if a
real estate dealer, Lot or Orlando; if a man
of wealth, Richard; if a debtor, Owen; and
if they wish him to "go to grass," Timothy.</p>

<hr class="hrsep" />

<p>The same degree of thoughtful care
should be exercised in naming girls, as well.
If a girl is to become a musician she should
be called Octavia or Dora; if a milliner,
Hattie; if a writer, Adaline; if a cook,
Dinah or Amelia; and so on to the end of
the chapter.</p>
